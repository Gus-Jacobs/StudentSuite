# codemagic.yaml
#
# This workflow is designed for building and publishing the iOS
# release version of your Flutter app to App Store Connect.
# It leverages Codemagic's automatic code signing using an App Store Connect API Key.

workflows:
  ios-release-build:
    name: iOS Release Build
    instance_type: mac_mini_m1 # Requires a Mac instance for iOS builds

    # --- Environment Variables ---
    environment:
      flutter: stable         # Specifies the Flutter channel to use
      xcode: latest           # Uses the latest available Xcode version on Codemagic
      cocoapods: default      # Uses the default CocoaPods version

      # Link the variable group where IOS_BUNDLE_ID and CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY are stored
      # This MUST match the name of your Variable Group in Codemagic UI.
      groups:
        - variables 

    # --- Integrations ---
    # This section links your workflow to the App Store Connect API Key configured in Codemagic UI.
    # It tells Codemagic which key to use for fetching signing files and publishing.
    integrations:
